# memefarm
A simple randomized meme generator, inspired
by Mila claiming to own a "meme farm."
`memefarm` is capable of churning out an
effectively unlimited number of unique memes.

## How

`memefarm` automatically generates randomized
memes by leveraging the wealth of images on the
internet, in conjunction with an english dictionary.
The english dictionary used is the list of the 1000
most common english words (in all their forms) which
was used to write "[Thing Explainer](https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/)"
and "[Up Goer Five](https://xkcd.com/1133/)."
`memefarm` will generate memes by picking a random
image from the internet (powered by a google search
for a random word), and then picking some random
words to overlay on the image.
